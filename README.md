# 🧠 AI Model

CyberShield-AI uses a supervised Machine Learning model based on the **Random Forest** algorithm.

The model was trained to distinguish normal network traffic from malicious activities using network flow features extracted from the CICIDS2017 dataset.

The application automatically loads the trained model, performs predictions on uploaded datasets, and generates a complete security report.

---

# 📂 Dataset

The project uses the **CICIDS2017** dataset.

This dataset contains realistic network traffic including both legitimate communications and several cyber attacks.

Examples include:

- BENIGN
- FTP-Patator
- SSH-Patator

The dataset provides dozens of network features used by the AI model for classification.
